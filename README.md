# Code-Refactor-01
code refactor for Horiseon Online Marketing, code bootcamp 01.




Project Description: This project was to refactor the code for Heriseon's web page, this will make the site more accessible for its users, allow it to be used by people who may have a disability, it will be optimized for search engines allowing maximum online traffic.

Tasks Accomplished:
Items in head are in the correct order.
add meta tags such as keywords, site description.
added a better title that fits the page.
added containers such as header, main, nav, aside, footer and made sure they are structured logically.
heading attributes are in order.
added alt attributes to the images for accessibility.
added proper indention making the code look good.
making the code look good and also easy to read.
fixed any broken code (the broken link for search-engine-optimization and a closing tag on an image).
I replaced divâ€™s with the right containers, so I had to change the selectors in my CSS to make sure all my styles were applied.
I got rid of any use-less CSS selectors, there were quite a few.
I put the CSS selectors in an order that was logical and easy to read.
